This project contains a Python script that automates the process of creating a new Facebook account using the Selenium WebDriver. The script opens the Facebook homepage, fills out the signup form with user-provided information, and submits the form.

Features
Automated Navigation: Opens the Facebook signup page and waits for it to load.
Form Filling: Automatically fills out the form fields including first name, last name, email/phone number, password, birth date, and gender based on user input.
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling to manage any issues that occur during form filling and submission.
User Interaction: Collects required information from the user via the console before filling out the form.
